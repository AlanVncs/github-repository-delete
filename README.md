# Github Easy Delete Repository
Google Chrome extension that helps to delete a Github repository

### What it does
This extension will automatically insert the string `"{username/{repository}"` when you click on the **Delete this repository** button<br>
It **will not** disable the authentication required (At the first repository delete) by Github

##### Any suggestions are welcome!
